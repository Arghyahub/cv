This is an how I like to setup my react project. I generally like to use [vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
its faster and than create-react-app and has a much cleaner setup.

If you are a bit lazy like me, download my [script](https://github.com/Arghyahub/SCRIPTS/tree/main/react) and execute it.

Or

Execute the following code :

```sh
wget -O react.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Arghyahub/SCRIPTS/main/react/react.sh
chmod +x react.sh
./react.sh
```

Or

# Continue with setup

Execute the following commands

```sh title="To create vite app and current folder"
npm create vite@latest .
```

Once you setup your react project you'll find some files, that you might not need. I generally clean them up

```plaintext
|-public
|   |-vite.svg // not req
|
|-src
|   |-assets // not req
```

Run this code to remove them

```sh
rm public/vite.svg
rm -r src/assets
```

The css files such as Index.css and App.css will have some default styles. We don't require that

```sh
echo > src/App.css
echo > src/index.css
```

Finally clean App.tsx or App.jsx files with some `tsrafce` or `rafce`

```js title="Paste this into your App.jsx or App.tsx"
import "./App.css";

const App = () => {
  return <div>App</div>;
};

export default App;
```

Don't forget the edit the favicon in html file

And we are done with a clean setup ✨.

# Typescript settings

The setup is done but if you are using Typescript, you might need to look at you `eslintrc` and `tsconfig` settings.

Here's what I use

```js {17-19} title="eslintrc.cjs" caption="I do not like getting no-unused-vars error, as a warning they are okay to me"
module.exports = {
  root: true,
  env: { browser: true, es2020: true },
  extends: [
    "eslint:recommended",
    "plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended",
    "plugin:react-hooks/recommended",
  ],
  ignorePatterns: ["dist", ".eslintrc.cjs"],
  parser: "@typescript-eslint/parser",
  plugins: ["react-refresh"],
  rules: {
    "react-refresh/only-export-components": [
      "warn",
      { allowConstantExport: true },
    ],
    "no-unused-vars": "off",
    "@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars": "warn",
    "@typescript-eslint/ban-types": "warn",
  },
};
```

```js {24} title="tsconfig.app.json"
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES2020",
    "useDefineForClassFields": true,
    "lib": ["ES2020", "DOM", "DOM.Iterable"],
    "module": "ESNext",
    "skipLibCheck": true,

    /* Bundler mode */
    "moduleResolution": "bundler",
    "allowImportingTsExtensions": true,
    "resolveJsonModule": true,
    "isolatedModules": true,
    "noEmit": true,
    "jsx": "react-jsx",

    /* Linting */
    "strict": false,
    "noUnusedLocals": false,
    "noUnusedParameters": false,
    "noFallthroughCasesInSwitch": false
  },
  "rules": {
    "no-unused-vars": false
  },
  "include": ["src", "/src/**.ts", "/src/**.tsx"],
  "exclude": ["node_modules"]
}
```

# Important packages

A simple react project alone is not the useful, we typically use external packages to
make things easy, get great features and improve developer experience.

# Tailwind CSS

[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) has revolutionized the web development experience.
It was a headache to assign different class names and ids to html elements and then style them
in their respective css files. We developers are aren't very efficient in coming up with names and searching them
in a css file and then thinking why the overflow is occurring blows our mind.

Other than the naming issue faced by most developers, another problem with css was maintaining standardization across the website.
Writing pixels of media queries, removing default css and what not. Tailwind has made things very easy and introduced
shorthands for writing css as class names.

Setup tailwind as follows

```sh
npm install -D tailwindcss@latest postcss@latest autoprefixer@latest
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

Update the tailwind config

```js {3} title="tailwind.config.js"
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: ["./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}"],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
};
```

Then put the tailwind directives into you css file

```css title="index.css or app.css"
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

And your tailwind setup is complete, try it out by writing

```js title="App.jsx" "bg-red-400"
import "./App.css";

const App = () => {
  return <div className="bg-red-400">App</div>;
};

export default App;
```

Run the app and if your tailwind is correctly configured the `App` background will be red else
follow the above steps again and don't forget to import the css file `import "./index.css"` .

# React Router

[React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) is by far the most import react package, it helps us creates different
routes and manage them seamlessly, it also provides us with hooks to navigate between routes, get current route
and many more.

Install react router like this:

```sh
npm install react-router
```

Use it like this

```js title="App.jsx" {6-12,21}
import { createBrowserRouter, Link, RouterProvider } from "react-router-dom";
import "./App.css";

const router = createBrowserRouter([
  {
    path: "/",
    element: (
      <div>
        <p>Home</p>
        <Link to="/test">Go to Test</Link>
      </div>
    ),
  },
  {
    path: "/test",
    element: <div>Test</div>,
  },
]);

const App = () => {
  return <RouterProvider router={router} />;
};

export default App;
```

# Zustand

[Zustand](https://zustand-demo.pmnd.rs/) has become my go-to state management library, it is very simple to use and
very light. Previously I used Recoil but Facebook stopped maintaining it and seriously no one likes to write context api or redux.

Install zustand like this

```sh
npm install zustand
```

# Shadcn UI

[Shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/) has become my go to UI library, it is very simple to use and you get the access to
the component code, so you can customize it how ever you want. You have the full creativity and control over it.

Install shadcn with vite is a little complicated, shadcn is primarily works well with [Nextjs](https://nextjs.org/)
but I have found solutions to make it work with vite.

<br />
**Pre-requisites**

- You must have [tailwind](#tailwind-css) installed

Then add these lines into your `tsconfig.json`

```json {2-7} title="tsconfig.json"
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["./src/*"]
    }
  },
  "files": [],
  "references": [
    {
      "path": "./tsconfig.app.json"
    },
    {
      "path": "./tsconfig.node.json"
    }
  ]
}
```

Also add the options into your `tsconfig.app.json`

```json {4-7} title="tsconfig.app.json"
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    /* Resolve path */
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["./src/*"]
    },

    "composite": true,
    "tsBuildInfoFile": "./node_modules/.tmp/tsconfig.app.tsbuildinfo",
    "target": "ES2020",
    "useDefineForClassFields": true,
    "lib": ["ES2020", "DOM", "DOM.Iterable"],
    "module": "ESNext",
    "skipLibCheck": true,

    /* Bundler mode */
    "moduleResolution": "bundler",
    "allowImportingTsExtensions": true,
    "resolveJsonModule": true,
    "isolatedModules": true,
    "moduleDetection": "force",
    "noEmit": true,
    "jsx": "react-jsx",

    /* Linting */
    "strict": true,
    "noUnusedLocals": true,
    "noUnusedParameters": true,
    "noFallthroughCasesInSwitch": true
  },
  "include": ["src"]
}
```

Install types/node

```sh
npm i -D @types/node
```

Edit the `vite.config` file

```ts title="vite.config.ts" {3,8-11}
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react";
import path from "path";

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      "@": path.resolve(__dirname, "./src"),
    },
  },
});
```

Now install shadcn

```sh
npx shadcn-ui@latest init
```

These are the options that I select

```plaintext {4} title="line-4 is Important"
√ Would you like to use TypeScript (recommended)? ... no / yes
√ Which style would you like to use? » Default
√ Which color would you like to use as base color? » Slate
√ Where is your global CSS file? ... src/index.css
√ Would you like to use CSS variables for colors? ... no / yes
√ Are you using a custom tailwind prefix eg. tw-? (Leave blank if not) ...
√ Where is your tailwind.config.js located? ... tailwind.config.js
√ Configure the import alias for components: ... @/components
√ Configure the import alias for utils: ... @/lib/utils
√ Are you using React Server Components? ... no / yes
√ Write configuration to components.json. Proceed? ... yes
```

Your setup is complete now you can install any shadcn component using the cli and directly copy paste code.

<br />
The setup is complete, this is how I setup my react projects and I hope you find
it useful ✨.
